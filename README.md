## Description

### User Story:
AS A music enthusiast
I want to see a bio of my favorite artist as well as top videos displayed in one location after my search
SO THAT I have the ability to research an artist and see videos in one spot

### Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a bio and video dashboard display

- WHEN I enter an artists name on a landing page and search THEN I am redirected to a display page for that artist
- When I am on the display page for the artist THEN I see the artists name a short bio provided by Wikipedia as well as five top videos from youTube.  
- When I am on the landing page or display page the UI is polished and interactive
- When I would like to search for another artist I am redirected to the landing page to perform another search

### Project Requirements

You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
